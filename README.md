# Ruwan Edu Website

When I was actively working on projects for Webacies, I created this Responsive Education Center Website for a organisation called Rfern - also pro-bono.
The source code and images added are for presentational (portfolio) purposes only as I did not include the functional scripting needded for email services, marketing, analytics etc. - that I kept to myself! 

In the beginning, I hardcoded everything in HTML - but if I had to remake this website I would use React or a templating language instead of pure HTML. Happy Coding :D
